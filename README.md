## Issues faced by me during this project and it's solution.

#### ----> Dividing the page into different sections.

Solution - Used Semantic Elements like <footer>
<header> and <div> to divide it into different sections and used it a desired location.



#### ----> Selection of font for the page.

Solution - The pre defined fonts are a little bit old school
but it works on majority of devices. If i had given any new installed font on my device
then it will not open smoothly on the other devices which dont have that fonts installed.
So i used google fonts by adding its link my HTML document which solved both the issues.

#### ----> Changing the opacity of the background of div changes the opacity of its child Elements.

Solution - Using "background-color: rgba(00, 00, 00, 0.7);" instead of "opacity:0.7;" did the magic.
